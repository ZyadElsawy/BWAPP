There is search box that is telling us to search for a movie , when we search for a movie such as " iron man " is searches for it in the database if the movie exists it returns back to us with some info.
Let's try to insert input like this " iron man '  " .
There is an error message came out " Error: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '%'' at line 1 "

This search box is vulnerable to SQL Injection
