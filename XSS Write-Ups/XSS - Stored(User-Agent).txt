When we enter the challenge there is a message displaying your user-agent header content and your ip in a table and says that this info is stored in the database.
Since we can't change our ip address lets change the content of user-agent header
So start the burpsuite and turn on the interception and click on the challenge again .
After intercepting the request try to change the content of user-agent header 
To anything else to see what happens , we notice that what ever the content of the user- agent header it is reflected on the challenge page.
Now we go back and intercept the request again and change the content of the user-agent header to this payload " <script>alert(1);</script> "

ALERTED!!!!!!!
