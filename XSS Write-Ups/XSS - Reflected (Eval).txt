When we first enter this challenge we saw this message " The current date on your computer is: " and it displays the current system time , when we inspect the paragraph that contains the time we saw this code 
"
<script>

    eval("document.write(Date())");

    </script>
"
And we noticed that there is a parameter in the url which is " date= " and its value is the function that displays the current time which is " date() "
Lets try to replace this function with " alert() " .
ALERTED!!!!!
